I'd like to make my first post on how fascinating is for us as human in which we are living in an era that we can understand and observe the world around us, not all of it, but at least the observable portion of it. To be hinest it's a bit mind bugling for me to think about us as human and how we became the dominant observer, at least on our home, planet earth! 

Given the age of observable universe (13.8 bilion years), and Darwin's revolutionary view on the emergence of life from nothing but a few atoms stuck together creating interactions that ultimately led to something we call it DNA, is mind bugling to see, we, humans, are the one who observe the universe. Modern human emerged and evolved from apes and there are scientists digging the past of human species on a particular interesting question of "What and how it happened to these apes back in around 500 years ago that they eventually formed the modern human, called Neanderthal!". Nobel prize winner (in Physiology or Medicine - 2022) Svante Pääbo has a very nice argument on this and he argues something crazy should have been happened that transformed modern human to more smart version evolving all the time which gave such astonishing intellectual ability to these species, in which one day they wake up and they ask "where we came from?". Some might speculate that maybe ants also wondering about the world around us and there might be some debates on this which I leave it on reader. But for me, it's astonishing to live in an era that we, as human, can ask such profound questions and make attempts to answer it.
