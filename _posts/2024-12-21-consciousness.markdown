Here I'd like to share my take from broadly recognized and debated arguments on mind-body problem. I don't have any specific source as I learn from so many sources but indeed I would love to cite master minds behind all these concepts, and some of them are of my heros. No matter how deep I'm thinking about the world around us yet the manifestation of lack of undersatnding of consciousness bothers me a lot and I just can't stop thinking about it!
